### Question 1 
**Create the variables with the following composition:**  
1. A vector containing each letter of your first name as its elements.  
2. A variable that contains your name concatenated from the vector created in (1)  
3. A variable containing a sequence from 100 to 120.  
4. Create a matrix of 3x3 dimensions that contains the even sequence of numbers starting from 2.  
5. Assign names to the variables.

**Create a variable containing a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100:**  
1. Iterate over the variables and print those numbers which are prime.  

**Create a variable var with a value of 1:**

        break
      }
    }
